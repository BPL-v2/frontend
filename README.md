# Frontend for BPL

## How to set up

Install node v24 and npm, run

```
echo "VITE_PUBLIC_BPL_BACKEND_URL = http://localhost/api
# VITE_PUBLIC_BPL_BACKEND_URL = https://bpl-poe.com/api" > .env
npm install
```

If you want to run against our production api, just comment/uncomment the other url in the .env file

## Help, how do I log in for testing - I'm just getting redirected to bpl-poe.com

Just grab your JWT from https://bpl-poe.com by opening your dev tools going to localstorage and copying the auth value to localhost.

## Icon generation

We download images from https://repoe-fork.github.io

Install python (latest probably works idk)

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r icon-generation/requirements.txt
python3 icon-generation/fetch_icons.py
```

## Updating the backend client

Run the backend go server on localhost and execute

```
npm run generate-client
```
